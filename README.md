A Spotlight-like launcher for Mac OS 9.

- Meant to be assigned to a "Hot Function Key" (or maybe an FKEY shortcut?)
- Compiles with CodeWarrior 6.
- Grab mac compatible project archives from the Releases.

On first launch, a folder within preferences is created (cmd+O will open it for you).
Place any aliases, files, directories, ... you want in there.
Then you just type the name and hit enter to launch. Super simple. Super basic.
