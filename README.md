A Spotlight-like launcher for Mac OS 7.5-9.x.

- Meant to be assigned to a "Hot Function Key", or FKEY shortcut.
- Compiles with CodeWarrior 6.
- Haven't actually done any testing on pre-9.2.2 systems yet.

On first launch, a folder within preferences is created (cmd+O will open it for you).
Place any aliases, files, directories, ... you want in there.
Then you just type the name and hit enter to launch. Super simple. Super basic.
